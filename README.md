# 99dmg-pick-ban-o-mat


## What is it good for ?
The app fetches all voting data from your opponents so you dont have to do it by hand. It also suggest picks and bans.

## How to use ?
Go to your 99damage team page and copy the url. 
Paste it in the corresponging text box at the top.
The app will now fetch all opponents this season and the voting data of the selected team. This is usually the next opponent. 
The rows bellow show the pick/ban suggestion/prediction.
In the bottom are 3 expander menus that hide the fetched raw data. It can be edited, for example if you want to remove all pick/bans that include a map that is no longer in the mappool. The pick/ban can be recalculated by pressing the purple "atom" button.

## On what basis are the suggestions/prediction made ?
The tool uses relative strenght as the primary metric. Strength is estimated by each teams willingness to pick/play/ban a map. Relative strength is just the differnce between the teams values. 
For example :

Team1 Inferno 	: 3Picks 0 Bans 4Pool  ->  10

Team2 Inferno	: 1Pick  2 Bans 2Pool  ->   0

=>	Team1 is favored on Inferno by +10

## The tool has a bug/flaw/missing feature when will it be fixed ?
Whenever I got time and agree with the proposed changes. Time is Money, so donations help speed it up. And there is always the option to change it yourself, since the source code is available.

## What changes are currently planned ?
Playoff support
